This is a slightly modified version of the adafruit sharp memory lcd library.
The modification is for the LS018B7DH02 1.8" memory LCD (and possibly others),
which require 9 bits to address their lines. The original readme is included as
README_ADAFRUIT.txt. The code can be found at
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SHARP_Memory_Display/
